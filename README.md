# all my suckless in stuff a repo
so if you never used any suckless software be4 i'll make a quick lil guide (it's pretty easy :3)
1. (this is gonna sound obvious but) clone the repo with git
2. maybe configure a few things to your liking in the config.h file
3. cd into the directory of the software and run "sudo make clean install"

Requirements:
JetbrainsMono font,
an X composite manager,
(for the pre-made shortcuts) steam and librewolf 

it comes included with the used patches

enjoy :3

and if sometime is not to your liking go change it for yourself!!! so dont even bother to make pull requests xd

this repo is originally only meant for me but i decided that id put this on public for other people to use :3
